    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data (non-numeric data) into a numerical format that can be used in machine learning algorithms. Categorical data includes features like text labels, categories, or other non-numeric values. Data encoding is essential in data science because many machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs.\n",

    "Improved Model Performance: Encoding categorical data correctly can improve the performance of machine learning models, as it enables the algorithms to recognize patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
