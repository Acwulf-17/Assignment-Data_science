    "GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The GET method is primarily used to request data from a specified resource on the web server. It is a \"safe\" and \"idempotent\" operation, meaning that it should not have any side effects on the server, and multiple identical requests should produce the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in URL: In a GET request, the data to be sent to the server is appended to the URL as query parameters. This means that data is visible in the URL, which can be a security concern, especially when dealing with sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching: GET requests are often cached by web browsers and intermediary caches, which can improve performance for subsequent requests to the same resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idempotence: GET requests are idempotent, meaning that making the same GET request multiple times should not change the server's state or produce different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It is not idempotent and can have side effects on the server, such as creating, updating, or deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in Body: In a POST request, the data to be sent is included in the body of the HTTP request. This allows for sending larger amounts of data and is suitable for operations that modify server data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: POST requests are considered more secure for transmitting sensitive information because the data is not visible in the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Idempotent: POST requests are non-idempotent, meaning that making the same POST request multiple times may result in different outcomes or state changes on the server."
