    "Ordinal Encoding is used for categorical data where the categories have an inherent order or rank. It assigns numerical values to categories based on this order. For example, \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High\" can be encoded as 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, on the other hand, is used for nominal categorical data where there is no inherent order among the categories. It assigns arbitrary numerical values to each category. For example, \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue\" can be encoded as 1, 2, and 3, without any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset of education levels, and the categories are \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD.\" If there is a clear order among these levels, you can use ordinal encoding, assigning values 1, 2, 3, and 4 to represent the increasing educational attainment. If there is no order and you just want to represent the levels as unique labels, you would use label encoding.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where categorical data is encoded based on its relationship with the target variable. It's useful when you have ordinal data, but the original order doesn't align with the target variable's order. The encoding values are determined based on the target variable's mean or median for each category.\n",

    "Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. It indicates whether two variables tend to increase or decrease together. A positive covariance means that when one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. A negative covariance means that when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. A covariance of zero indicates no linear relationship between the variables.\n",

    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps in understanding the degree and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It's used in various fields, including finance, economics, and data analysis. However, covariance alone doesn't provide information about the strength of the relationship, and it can be sensitive to the scale of the variables."
