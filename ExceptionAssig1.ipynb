    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a wide range of built-in exception types to handle different types of errors. Common exceptions include TypeError, ValueError, IndexError, FileNotFoundError, and ZeroDivisionError, among others.\n",
    "You can also define custom exceptions by creating your own exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling in Python is done using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
    "Code that might raise an exception is placed inside the try block, and you can specify one or more except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions.\n",
    "The else block is executed if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
    "The finally block is used for code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences Between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions and syntax errors are both types of errors in Python, but they occur at different stages of program execution:\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the runtime (when the program is executing) and are typically caused by unexpected situations or invalid data.\n",
    "Syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code (when the program is being compiled) and are caused by violations of Python's syntax rules. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all."

This can result in an abrupt and uncontrolled termination of the program."
